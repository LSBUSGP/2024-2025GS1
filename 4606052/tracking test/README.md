# Tracking
fire a projectile at a moving target and correctly predict its future position

the TrackingTest scene contains the demo with full accuracy to prove its correctly predicting the targets position, the "Rule of Cool" scene just has some tweaks to the turret that a normal game would want to have, such as bullet spread and a faster turret rotation speed.
press spacebar to add some motion to the targets.

i also explain a lot of my thought process in the code comments so if it looks like i have made a strange decision you can probably find the explanation commented onto it.
