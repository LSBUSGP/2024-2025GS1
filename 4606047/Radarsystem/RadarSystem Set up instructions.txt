Radar Scene Setup:
1. Create a Canvas (Screen Space–Overlay).
2. Under Canvas, add an Image named "RadarUI" (e.g. 200×200 px).  
   (Optional) Add a Mask + circular sprite for a round radar.
3. In the scene, create a UI Image named "RadarIcon" and assign a small dot sprite.  
   • Drag it into Assets/Prefabs to make it a prefab, then delete it from the scene.
4. In your Project window, create Assets/Scripts and add two files:  
   • RadarContact.cs (empty MonoBehaviour)  
   • Radar.cs   (radar manager script)
5. In the Hierarchy, create an empty GameObject named "RadarManager" and attach the Radar.cs script.
6. In the Inspector on RadarManager, set:  
   • Player → your player’s Transform  
   • Radar UI → the RadarUI Image  
   • Icon Prefab → the RadarIcon prefab  
   • Radar Range → e.g. 100
7. On every GameObject you want tracked (enemies, pickups, etc.), add the RadarContact component.
8. Press Play: any GameObject with RadarContact will spawn an icon in RadarUI, moving so “up” = player forward.
