1. Create four cubes named Cube1–Cube4.
2. Add an empty GameObject named "FrequencyDetector".
3. Attach the AudioFrequency script to it and add an AudioSource with your music clip.
4. In the Inspector, set:
   • Frequencies (e.g. 100, 500, 1000, 3000)
   • Thresholds (e.g. 0.02, 0.015, 0.01, 0.005)
   • Sample Size (e.g. 1024)
   • Drag Cube1–Cube4 into the Targets array.
5. Play: each cube appears when its frequency's amplitude exceeds its threshold.
